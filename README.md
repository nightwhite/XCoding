# XCoding

A new IDE for Vibe Coding.

Built to stay light, clean, and fast—so you can ship with focus: multiple projects, multiple tasks, fewer interruptions, lower footprint.

## What you’ll do with it

- Work on multiple projects side by side
- Code while running commands and previewing your app
- Ask AI at any time, then apply or roll back changes in one step

## What makes it different

- Multi-project: manage several projects in one window, switch with `Cmd/Ctrl+1..8`
- Multi-task: editor, terminal, preview, and AI live in one workspace
- Lightweight: quick start, low footprint—stays responsive under load
- Opinionated core: no plugin marketplace—built-ins cover the main path
